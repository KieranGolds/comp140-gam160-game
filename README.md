# Part A 

## Basic idea 
This game will be an fps in which you are stationery, shooting oncoming targets in order to survive. You as the player will hold a gun like controller that will have an accelerometer in order to aim at these given targets.
## Mechanics
The aim in this game is to achieve a high score which is achieved through surviving for longer times and the amount of targets you shoot. The accelerometer on your controller will control your aim in both the x and y axis. Movement may be incorperated in a later stage through the use of a thumbstick.  
### Updated
The player will be shooting targets in a shooting gallery which will support both mouse and my controller idea of putting the accelerometer to use through the aim. The player will have to shoot the targets within a given time frame which will add to their score. However the window in which they can shoot the next target is reduced.

I was inspired by some of these controllers from the convention 'AltCtrlGDC' as they are not only experimenting with the controller designs but the platforms on which they are playing on. Some, like us, are using Unreal and Unity. However in the link to the image above the top left image uses a cylindrical mount of LEDs. I like this idea as it can be similar to robotics. The hardware you are using itself can change the purpose of your game completely. 

The third link in the ones above gave me some ideas of how i wanted to make my controller and game. Everyone mentioned has a completely unique idea that hasnt been done before. The webpage also goes into some detail about each which was helpful for generating my own.

## Description of my controller

My controller will have the player aiming at the targets in the game through the use of a gyroscopetaking in the movement of the player and moving the characters aim accordingly. Movement is also intended to be added through the use of a thumbstick. 

## Design of my controller

My controller has intentions to be in the shape of a two handed small guns which the player can aim easily while having access to a thumbstick and a fire button/trigger. Linked below are a few images of which my controller would look similar to for an end product.
